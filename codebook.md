## Codebook
This is the codebook for the TidyData dataset
## Data Source
The data source is based on the recordings of 30 subjects performing the activities of daily living while carrying a waist mounted smartphone with embedded inertia sensors. 
The 6 activities measured in the dataset are:
1. Walking
2. Walking upstairs
3. Walking downstairs
4. Sitting
5. Standing
6. Laying

The measurements for each activity are based on the XYZ readings from the accelerometer and gyroscope respectively. Each record in the database contains: 
- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration. 
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

## Transformations carried out
The following transformations were carried out on the original data: 
- training and test data sets were merged to create a single data set
- the reference tables for the feature and activity labels were added into the merged data set
- only measurements relating to mean and standard deviations are retained in the merged data set
- descriptive variable names were added to replace the original variable names
- a tidy data set is created by aggregating the merged data set based on the average variable for each activity and subject.

## Variables
The following are the list of variables in the TidyData.txt. There are 30 subjects, and for each subject, the mean and standard deviation of each measurement is noted for each of the 6 activities.
